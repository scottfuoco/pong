# Key Bindings

* z : down
* q : ki blast

#### Player 2:
* ▲ : up
* ▼ : down
* ◄ : ki blast

#### Shared Controls:
* Spacebar : Summon new ball / new game

# How to Play 
##### Move Up and Down to hit the power ball and knock it back towards your enemy. Don't forget to use your ki blast to try and score extra points. Just remember that if the other player hits your ki blast it is removed and you wont get a point.  You will also want to note that due to fatigue your character will begin to slow down as each round progresses so make sure you are getting into position right away.
